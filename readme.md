Akari

In this project, I used the model-view-controller design pattern together with the JavaFX UI library to design a complete, functioning GUI implementation of the single-player logic puzzle akari. Users are able to use my app to play akari and solve a variety of built-in puzzles.

Here is a demo video: https://youtu.be/rHbOdv80YjU
